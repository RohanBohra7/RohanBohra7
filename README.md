# Technical Introduction

## Overview
I am a Computer Science student focused on building strong fundamentals in programming, problem-solving, and core CS concepts. My primary goal is to develop a deep understanding of computer science rather than chasing superficial trends. I believe in learning by building, debugging, and iterating on real projects.

---

## Core Focus Areas
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Core Computer Science Fundamentals
- Systematic Problem Solving
- Software Development Principles

---

## Technical Skills

### Programming Languages
- Java (Primary)
- C (Foundational understanding)
- JavaScript (Basic familiarity)

### Core Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees and Graph Fundamentals (Learning Phase)

### Tools & Technologies
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
- Command Line Interface
- Basic Web Development (HTML, CSS)

---

## Current Learning Goals
- Strengthening DSA for problem-solving efficiency
- Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code
- Understanding low-level implementation details
- Building small but conceptually strong projects
- Improving debugging and logical thinking ability

---

## Development Philosophy
I focus on:
- Clarity over shortcuts
- Depth over surface-level knowledge
- Consistency over motivation
- Logic over memorization

I aim to write code that is readable, efficient, and logically sound rather than overly complex or flashy.

## What You’ll Find in My Repositories
- Concept-focused Java programs
- Data Structures implementations from scratch
- Problem-solving exercises
- Small projects demonstrating core CS fundamentals
- Experiments while learning new concepts

Each repository reflects my learning journey and improvement in writing structured and optimized code.
